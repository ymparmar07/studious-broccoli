1. Write a program to check whether a given number is divisible by 3 and divisible by 2.

#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
 
 int n;
 
 printf("enter number :");
 scanf("%d",&n);
	if(n!=0){
		if (n%2==0 && n%3==0){
			printf("number is devisible by 2 and 3 ");
		}else{
			printf("number is not devisible by 2 and 3 ");
		}
	}else{
		printf("0 is not valid number ");
	}
	
}

2. Write a program to check whether a given number is divisible by 7 or divisible by 3.


#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
 
 int n;
 
 printf("enter number :");
 scanf("%d",&n);
	if(n!=0){
		if (n%3==0 || n%7==0){
			printf("number is devisible by 3 or 7 ");
		}else{
			printf("number is not devisible by 3 or 7 ");
		}
	}else{
		printf("0 is not valid number ");
	}
}
